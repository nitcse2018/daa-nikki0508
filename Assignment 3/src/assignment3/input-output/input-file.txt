--Byte Streams--
Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes.
All byte stream classes are descended from InputStream and OutputStream.

There are many byte stream classes.
To demonstrate how byte streams work, we'll focus on the file I/O byte streams, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
Other kinds of byte streams are used in much the same way; they differ mainly in the way they are constructed.

--Character Streams--
The Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions.
Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from the local character set.
In Western locales, the local character set is usually an 8-bit superset of ASCII.

For most applications, I/O with character streams is no more complicated than I/O with byte streams.
Input and output done with stream classes automatically translates to and from the local character set.
A program that uses character streams in place of byte streams automatically adapts to the local character set and is ready for internationalization — all without extra effort by the programmer.

If internationalization isn't a priority, you can simply use the character stream classes without paying much attention to character set issues. Later, if internationalization becomes a priority, your program can be adapted without extensive recoding.
See the Internationalization trail for more information.
